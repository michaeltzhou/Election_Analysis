# Election_Analysis# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections Employee has given you the followings tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1) Calculate the total number of votes cast
2) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3) Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidates won
5) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Sources: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.7, Visual Studio Code 1.71.0

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369711 votes cast in the election
- The Candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85213 number of votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272892 number of votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to apply knowledge learned about Python to add further analysis to the election audit by tallying the voters by county and determining the county with the largest voter turnout. This was done through additional lines to the python code to count the votes by county.
## Challenge Summary
-Denver county had the largest voter turnout at 306055 votes, which constituted 82.8% of the votes counted
Something to note is that when printing the county votes, there was a line break between each county in the terminal. If it makes a significant difference in deliverables score, the code could probably be amended to include the line break when writing for each file but not when printing to the terminal, as it automatically generates a line break.
